> **Just A Boring Portfolio Blog Writer**

JABPBW is an automated blog-writing tool used to generate and refine posts for my personal portfolio.

It analyzes existing posts, proposes new topics, writes a draft, critiques it, and outputs a final, publish-ready article.

There’s nothing fancy here — the interesting part is how it’s built, not what it claims to be.
